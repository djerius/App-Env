0.26  2012-03-29T15:47:34-0400

  [ENHANCEMENT]

    * added App::Env::Null module for "null" (i.e. current)
      environment

0.25  2012-01-13T12:43:22-0400

  [BUG FIX]

    * qexec always acted as if it were being called in a scalar
      context.


0.24  2010-06-07T17:14:37-0400

    * the SysFatal option will now be passed on to cloned environments
      created with the Temp option.

0.23  2010-06-07T16:44:26-0400

    * capture() is no longer just an alias for qexec; it can now
      return both stderr and stdout.

0.22  2010-06-03T12:44:43-0400

    * if CacheID is the string 'AppID', the cache id does not take
      into account the contents of the AppOpts hash.

    * new feature from v. 0.20 2015-05-20T16:52:10-0400 AppOpts hash)
      now actually works.

0.21  2010-06-02T10:28:42-0400

    * no longer uses Object::ID to work around problems with
      Hash::FieldHash and older perls.

0.20  2010-05-28T12:11:51-0400

    * cached environments now keyed off of AppOpts hash
    * (hopefully) improve Windows compatibility

0.15  2008-10-27T14:10:29-0400

    * invert logic of shell magic characters; escape those not known to
      good.

0.14  2008-07-11T21:17:02-0400

    * escape more shell magic characters

0.13  2008-07-11T15:59:30-0400

    * append semi-colons to appenv's dumpenv output so that shell
      eval's will actually work

0.12  2008-07-11T13:31:09-0400

    * appenv's dumpenv has more output formats. its value is now required.
      previously it was optional, which led to its grabbing
      the environment name if --env wasn't used. bad form.

0.11  2008-06-16T12:27:20-0400

    * new setenv() method allows changing an environment.

0.10  2008-06-15T23:26:29-0400

    * new SysFatal option which will cause system/qexec/capture object
      methods to throw an exception on error.  Uses
      IPC::System::Simple in this case.

    * Default option values may now be changed.

 0.09  2008-03-22T22:44:32-0400

    * lowercase aliasing failed if Site was not set.

0.08  2008-03-22T22:03:47-0400

    * application module search is no longer sensitive to the case of
      the application name

0.07  2008-03-22T13:19:29-0400

    * application environments may now have aliases, which can preset
      options

    * site search was not done exactly according to specs

    * improved method for searching for environment modules to
      distinguish between non-existant modules and compilation errors

    * env() (and now str() as well) can specify variables to include
      in a more flexible fashion.  the returned value is more flexible
      (more context dependent) and excruciatingly documented.

    * more restrictive str() generation of TERMCAP to make it easier
      to exclude variables without needing to specify TERMCAP


0.06  2008-02-03T14:11:39-0400

    * fix for multi-app environments

    * application environments must now be based upon the current
      environment

    * cached application environments are not used in multi-app
      environments, nor will individual environments be cached in the
      course of creating a multi-app environment

0.05  2008-01-17T15:15:38-0400

    * improve(?) documentation

    * add appexec program

 0.04  2007-08-17T17:02:34-0400

    * clean up passing of AppOpts to app env module's envs() func

0.03  2007-08-17T12:26:32-0400

    * remove dependency on Module::Load::Conditional

0.02  2007-08-16T17:10:27-0400

    * work around lack of weak references in older perls

0.01  2007-07-26T17:39:40-0400
